   <p>I am currently a second year graduate student in the Department

  <p>As an undergraduate at the University of Washington, I worked with Professor 
  <a href="http://depts.washington.edu/chem/people/faculty/reinhardt.html">William Reinhardt</a> on aspects of modeling
  processes in Bose-Einstein Condensates (BECs).</p>

  <div class="content orange">
    <p> During my senior year, I worked on simulating BEC splitting experiments, in which a single well potential is deformed
    into a double well potential. In the initial state, the Gross-Pitaevski (GP) equation describes the condensate. In the final state,
    the system is well modeled by the two mode Bose-Hubbard Hamiltonian. Graduate Student Douglas Faust developed a technique for simulating intermediate
    regimes, and I developed computer programs to implement this technique in two spatial dimensions. </p>

  <p> My work on this topic was presented at the 2009 DAMOP Conference (<a href="Papers/DAMOP_Abstract.pdf">abstract</a>), the 2009 
    University of Washington Undergraduate Research Symposium, and the Quantum Chemistry and Quantum Computational Physics in the Theory 
    of Ultra-cold Gasses Workshop at the <a href="http://www.telluridescience.org/">Telluride Science Research Center</a>. </p>

    <p>For my first project, I investigated the possibility of directly measuring Schr&#246;dinger Cat type states in BECs.
  Using the framework of quantum state diffusion (QSD) I considered the effects of measurement on extreme superposition 
  states, including particle loss. We hoped to explore whether direct measurement of less extreme superposition states might 
  be possible. The group eventually developed a truncated model which captured the important features of the full QSD 
  calculations at much lower computational cost. This model is described in the following paper:</p>

  recoil detector.</p>

  <p>At UC Berkeley I have been a Graduate Student Instructor (GSI) for the following courses:
    <ul>
     <li>Physics 8B, Fall 2009
     <li>Physics 7A, Spring 2009
     <li>Physics 7B, Fall 2010 (Head GSI and section GSI)

  <p>From 2007 to 2009, I was the lead physics tutor at the University of Washington's 
  <a href="http://depts.washington.edu/clue/index.php">Center for Learning and Undergraduate Enrichment</a> (CLUE). At CLUE I
  tutored physics classes at all levels with a focus on students in algebra or calculus based introductory courses.</p>
